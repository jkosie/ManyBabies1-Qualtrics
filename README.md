# ManyBabies1-Qualtrics

This repo contains ALL the raw data qualtrics surveys given to MB1 participants. This is kept separate from the main analyses initially because it contains lab-identifying data that we don't plan to make public. Data in this repository needs to be cleaned to the point that we can divide and then share the anonymized and/or matched datasets over to the main repository.
