For eye tracking studies, the RA is trained on the appropriate software and given the ability to run through test sessions with other RAs or adults. Next, the RA watches 2-3 participants fully run by the PI, and, if available, watches videos of the PI or other RAs running the studies as well. Finally, the RA is given the opportunity to assist with parts of a real subject (e.g., starting up the eye tracking protocol with assistance) and to fully run a few pilot participants (normally, those who are either out of the targeted age range or who are preterm and thus could not be used in the final dataset).","As stated above, before running a 'real' participant the RA both partially-runs (assists) or fully runs pilot subjects with the PI in the room (or with the ability for the PI to watch video footage of the session with the RA afterwards).

We only collect information about the baby's gender and date of birth and decide whether to schedule the baby based solely on these two pieces of information. We collect these through various means I described in the previous section. Once the family is in, we give them a questionnaire that asks about whether the baby is full-term, typically developing, and has normal hearing. In addition, because most studies we conduct in the lab involves music perception, we ask whether the baby has frequent ear infection, whether there is a history of hearing problems in the family, whether the baby is exposed to unusual noise and whether he or she has cold on the day of testing.

Because all ongoing studies in the lab require online coding, students go through a training and they have to become reliable in coding eye-gaze before starting testing infants. For this, we have a detailed written protocol about how to set up each infant study and how to code eye gaze. As a first step, students are asked to read this carefully. Then, students and I first go through 1-2 experimental session videos from previous studies that were coded by me and I explain the technical details of the procedure. Then they have to code 3-4 videos that were previously coded. Some of these videos are more difficult to code than others (e.g., the infant is not very stable etc). Students' coding has to agree with at least 90% of the frames in all these videos. So far, I only had 2 graduate students who are involved in infant testing and both passed this training successfully. After this, students observe me while setting up and testing 3-4 babies. After this, they test at least 2-3 babies while I am present. If everything goes well, they start testing alone and they are assisted by an undergraduate RA. I also check the videos of the first couple of babies they test and code online to see if there are any problems.","They have to code at least 3 videos from previous experimental sessions and have to agree at least on 90% of the frames. Then they have to watch while I (or another experienced researcher in the lab) test 3-4 babies.

If everything seems ok, I let the graduate students test infants by themselves with the help of an undergraduate RA.

Exceptions are when: (1) the researcher speaks Hungarian and thus does not need assistance of an RA, (2) RA tests on her own (currently all RAs are female), because of researcher's illness or travel, but only if this is agreed on in advance, (3) a procedure is developed with involvement of the RA and researcher is not needed at all for data collection (e.g. because the procedure relies on an interaction between a toddler and Hungarian-speaking RAs). Consequently over the course of their employment RAs gain extensive training in assisting with and sometimes running-first hand various methodologies.  For ManyBabies we follow this standard model of data-acquisition at CDC. Most babies will be tested by MIkołaj Hernik (Associate Research Fellow with over 9 years of infancy research) assisted by an RA with over 3 years of experience in assisting with  (and occasionally running) infants studies at CDC, including working with the EyeLink eyetracker.  The procedure of ManyBabies was piloted with about 10 12-15-month-olds in order for both the researcher and the RA to get acquainted with procedure elements not common in our typical procedures (e.g. blinding mums with headphones) and to get a sense of older-babies behavior in the task.  When the researcher (MH) is not available for testing, some babies may be tested by the RA, who typically assists in the study, assisted by an RA in training.","See previous answer. Typically an RA is has already considerable experience running some infant paradigms.
