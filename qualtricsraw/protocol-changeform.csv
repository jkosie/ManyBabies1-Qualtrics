Our lab was only ready to start collecting data mid December. Given the need to have two experimenters present, we only had our personnel on the ground end January.  Due to the bilingual population in our area, our lab database didn’t contain a single infant that met the criteria when we started testing. We have tried several avenues for baby recruitment (flyer drop-offs at daycares, paid Facebook ads, our newsletter, uni sports centre), which resulted in one participant by mid Feb.
